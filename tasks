## LOCATIONS

### Node 1: Ancient Steam Vents
**Description:** "Natural geysers erupt, sending steam skyward. The ground is fractured with colorful mineral deposits. This is the hottest point in the volcanic plains."
**Item:** thermal_data
**Action:** `take thermal_data` → "You collect thermal data. Readings show 180°C at 2km depth."

### Node 2: Natural Hot Springs
**Description:** "Steaming pools of turquoise water surrounded by white terraces. The water is heated by geothermal energy below."
**NPC:** Kenji
**Dialogue:** "These springs have been here for generations. The power plant taps deeper reservoirs - the springs remain untouched. Perfect balance between energy and nature."

### Node 3: Thermal Observatory
**Description:** "A monitoring station on volcanic rock. Equipment measures ground temperature and seismic activity. Digital displays show thermal maps of underground reservoirs."
**NPC:** Dr. Elena Voss
**Dialogue (before thermal_data):** "I study thermal activity here. The Steam Vents show incredible heat at 2km depth! Collect thermal data from there to help our research."
**Dialogue (after thermal_data):** "Excellent! The data shows this reservoir can provide sustainable energy for decades. Geothermal heat keeps regenerating naturally."
**Action:** `use permit` → Start quiz

### Node 4: Steam Separator Station
**Description:** "A facility where superheated brine separates into steam and water. Large pressure vessels dominate the space. Steam drives turbines while water is reinjected underground."
**NPC:** James
**Dialogue:** "This separator is the heart of the operation. We extract steam, generate power, then reinject water to maintain the reservoir. The system runs 24/7, unlike solar or wind."

### Node 5: Geothermal Plant Exterior
**Description:** "The main facility with cooling towers and turbine buildings. This plant generates 50 megawatts of constant renewable power."
**NPC:** Chief Engineer Rodriguez
**Dialogue (first visit):** "Welcome! This plant generates 50 megawatts constantly. Geothermal never stops, unlike solar or wind. Here's your permit - take the certification quiz at the observatory."
**Action (auto):** Give permit to player
**Dialogue (subsequent):** "Geothermal connects everything - natural heat, monitoring, processing, and generation. You're seeing the complete cycle of sustainable energy."

## QUIZ (Observatory)

**Trigger:** `use permit` at Node 3

**Question 1:** "What is the main advantage of geothermal energy over solar and wind?"
- A) Cheaper to build
- B) Provides constant 24/7 power ✓
- C) Uses less land
- D) Easier to maintain

**Question 2:** "What happens to the water after it's used in a geothermal plant?"
- A) Released into rivers
- B) Reinjected back underground ✓
- C) Evaporated completely
- D) Stored in tanks

**Question 3:** "At what depth do geothermal plants typically access hot water?"
- A) 100-500 meters
- B) 1-3 kilometers ✓
- C) 5-10 kilometers
- D) 20+ kilometers

**Pass Requirement:** 2 out of 3 correct
**Reward:** geothermal_certificate

## INVENTORY ITEMS
