DETAILED NODE DESCRIPTIONS
NODE 1: VOLCANIC PLAINS ENTRANCE (Starting Point)
Connections:

North → Observatory
South → Village
East → Hot Springs
West → Control Room

NPCs: None
Items: None
Description:
"You stand at the entrance to the Volcanic Plains. Heat shimmers rise from dark basalt rocks in all directions. To the north, you see a research station. To the east, steam rises from natural pools. To the south, a small village nestles in the valley. To the west, you hear the hum of machinery."
First-time hint: "The geothermal facility sprawls across this volcanic landscape. Multiple paths lead to different parts of the operation. Exploration will reveal how everything connects."

NORTH-EAST BRANCH (Research Zone)
NODE 2: THERMAL OBSERVATORY
Connections:

South → Entrance
North → Steam Vents
East → Monitoring Well

NPCs: Dr. Elena Voss
Items: None
Description:
"A monitoring station built on a rocky outcrop. Scientific equipment measures ground temperature and seismic activity. Through the eastern window, you spot another facility - a monitoring well with drilling equipment. To the north, steam plumes rise from ancient vents."
NPC: Dr. Elena Voss (Geologist)

Command: talk
Dialogue: "Welcome! I study thermal activity here. The Steam Vents to the north are incredible - 180°C at just 2km depth! I also maintain the Monitoring Well to the east. If you collect thermal data from the vents, it would help map the entire reservoir system. Both facilities are connected to my research."


NODE 3: ANCIENT STEAM VENTS
Connections:

South → Observatory

NPCs: None
Items: thermal_data (on ground)
Description:
"Natural geysers erupt periodically, sending towers of steam skyward. The ground is fractured with mineral deposits in brilliant colors. This is the northern edge of the geothermal reservoir - the hottest point in the region. The air is thick with sulfur and heat."
Interactive Elements:

Command: take thermal_data
Response: "You carefully measure the temperature and pressure. The readings are extraordinary - this northern reservoir connects underground to the entire system. The data device records everything."


NODE 4: MONITORING WELL
Connections:

West → Observatory
South → Hot Springs
East → (blocked - "Dense volcanic rock blocks passage east")

NPCs: None
Items: equipment_parts (on ground)
Description:
"A narrow borehole descends deep into the earth, surrounded by monitoring equipment and sensors. Cables run south toward the Hot Springs area. This well measures reservoir pressure and temperature at multiple depths. Some spare equipment parts lie near the wellhead."
Interactive Elements:

Command: take equipment_parts
Response: "You pick up the spare sensor parts. These might be useful at the separator station - equipment there is always in need of maintenance."
Note: Taking equipment_parts makes minigame slightly easier (reduces required attempts from 3 to 5)


EAST-SOUTH BRANCH (Natural Features & Processing)
NODE 5: NATURAL HOT SPRINGS
Connections:

West → Entrance
North → Monitoring Well
South → Separator Station

NPCs: Kenji
Items: None
Description:
"Steaming pools of turquoise water create a natural spa. The water is heated by the same geothermal reservoir that powers the plant. Pipes run south toward the industrial facilities, while monitoring equipment connects north to the well. This location sits above a major intersection of underground thermal channels."
NPC: Kenji (Spring Keeper)

Command: talk
Dialogue: "These springs have been here for generations. The power plant taps deeper reservoirs - the springs remain pristine. See how the monitoring well to the north connects here? The entire system is mapped. Water flows naturally, and we harness just a fraction of its energy."


NODE 6: STEAM SEPARATOR STATION
Connections:

North → Hot Springs
South → Plant Exterior
West → Control Room

NPCs: James
Items: None
Description:
"A critical facility where superheated brine is separated into steam and water. Large pressure vessels dominate the space. Pipes connect north to the hot springs reservoir, south to the main plant, and west to the control systems. This is where raw geothermal heat becomes manageable energy."
NPC: James (Plant Operator)

Command: talk
Dialogue (before permit): "This separator is the heart of the operation. It connects to the control room to the west and the main plant to the south. Only authorized personnel can adjust the settings."
Dialogue (after permit, before minigame): "You have clearance! The separator needs optimization. Can you adjust the pressure and temperature controls?"
Command: use permit (triggers minigame)

MINIGAME - Separator Optimization:

Objective: Adjust pressure to 75 bar and temperature to 180°C
Starting values: 50 bar, 150°C
Commands:

pressure +10/+5/-5/-10
temperature +10/+5/-5/-10
apply - Submit settings


Success range: Pressure 70-80 bar, Temperature 175-185°C
Attempts: 3 (or 5 if player has equipment_parts)
Reward: optimization_certificate
Hint if player has equipment_parts: "The spare parts you brought help calibrate the sensors more accurately. You have extra attempts to get it right."


NODE 10: GEOTHERMAL PLANT EXTERIOR
Connections:

North → Separator Station
West → (blocked - "Security fence blocks western passage")

NPCs: Chief Engineer Rodriguez
Items: permit, toolkit (given by NPC)
Description:
"The main facility with cooling towers and turbine buildings. This is the southern anchor of the geothermal operation. From here, processed steam from the separator (to the north) drives the turbines. The entire system comes together in this building."
NPC: Chief Engineer Rodriguez

Command: talk
First conversation: "Welcome! This plant generates 50 megawatts constantly. The separator feeds us steam from the north, which connects to the hot springs reservoir, which connects to the monitoring systems. It's all one integrated system. Here's your permit and toolkit - explore and learn how it all works together."

Auto-give: permit and toolkit


Subsequent: "The beauty of geothermal is how everything connects - natural reservoirs, monitoring, processing, and generation. You're seeing the whole picture now."


WEST-SOUTH BRANCH (Control & Community)
NODE 7: CENTRAL CONTROL ROOM
Connections:

East → Entrance
North → Village
Southeast → Separator Station

NPCs: Lisa
Items: None
Description:
"The nerve center monitoring all systems. Screens display data from the observatory, monitoring well, hot springs sensors, separator, and plant. You can see how information flows from every location. This room connects to the village to the north and has a direct line to the separator to the southeast."
NPC: Lisa (Control Engineer)

Command: talk
Dialogue (without permit): "The control room receives data from every part of the facility. I can see the entire network from here. Only certified personnel can access the systems."
Dialogue (with permit): "Ready for your certification? The quiz tests your understanding of how all these connected systems work together."
Command: use permit (triggers quiz)

WEST BRANCH (Community Zone)
NODE 8: THERMAL VILLAGE
Connections:

North → Entrance
South → Control Room
West → Greenhouse

NPCs: Mayor Chen
Items: None
Description:
"A small community heated by the geothermal system. Steam pipes run south to the control room and connect to the broader network. To the west, you see a large greenhouse glowing in the twilight. The village sits at the intersection of energy production and community benefit."
NPC: Mayor Chen

Command: talk
Dialogue: "Our village connects directly to the control systems to the south. We receive both electricity and heating from the network. The greenhouse to the west uses the same heat. We're part of the integrated system - not just customers, but participants in sustainable energy."


NODE 9: GEOTHERMAL GREENHOUSE
Connections:

East → Village

NPCs: Farmer Diego
Items: None
Description:
"A lush glass structure at the western edge of the facility. Tropical plants thrive on waste heat from the power system. This is the furthest point from the steam vents, yet Earth's heat still reaches here through the network of pipes and systems. The end point of the energy journey."
NPC: Farmer Diego

Command: talk
Dialogue: "I'm at the end of the line - west of the village, far from the vents and the plant. But the heat still reaches me perfectly. That shows how well-designed this system is. The same heat that starts as steam in the north becomes productive energy here in the west. Every bit is used."
